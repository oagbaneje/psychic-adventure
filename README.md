# Scorecard

This repo contains a program that inputs a csv file and outputs a json file.
The `calculate_score` function takes in a credit application and calculates the credit using the obligor rating and facility features.
The `accept_reject` function determines if the application is accepted or rejected.
To use it go to the run the `scorer.py` in python.


# In progress
Working on a sample JSON file for testing the application
Replacing `scorer.py` with `scorecard.py`
